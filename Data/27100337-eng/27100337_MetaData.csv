1,"In-house or intramural research and development refers to research and development that is performed within the organization, whatever the source of funds. In-house research and development comprise creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge - including knowledge of humankind, culture and society - and devise new applications of available knowledge."
2,"Refer to the attached link for a complete listing of the <a href="http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVDIndex&adm=0&dis=0&TVD=214300"> industry groups</a> and their associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)."
3,"The sum of individual categories may not always add to the total due to rounding."
4,"Data quality indicators are based on the coefficient of variation (CV) and number of observations. Quality indicators indicate the following: A - Excellent (CV between 0% and 4.9%); B - Very good (CV between 5.0% and 9.9%); C - Good (CV between 10.0% and 14.9%); D - Acceptable (CV between 15.0% and 24.9%); E - Use with caution (CV between 25.0% and 34.9%); F - Too unreliable to be published (CV greater than or equal to 35.0%)."
5,"Classification of companies into North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and county of control is determined for the survey population at time of reference year sampling."
6,"In-house research and development personnel is measured in full-time equivalent (FTE). Full-time equivalent or a person-year is equal to the number of persons who work solely on research and development projects and an estimate of time of persons working part of their time on research and development."
8,"Values may have been randomly adjusted to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act. The quality indicators reflect the impact on the precision of the estimate of sampling, non-response and the random adjustment when applied."
7,"North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industry group 61 excludes 611310."
